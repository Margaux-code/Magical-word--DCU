# Magical-word--DCU

This assignment is a project in C++ for my class OOP with Embedded Systems, it  has for theme a Magical word.
My assignment was :
Your first assignment is to write a single body of code example that integrates and demonstrates the following aspects of OOP in C++:
1. Inheritance through the use of multiple classes. This should include multiple inheritance as one example, which does not have to make perfect sense in the real-world. (Please note Point 2.)
2. Separate compilation with all classes in your assignment (i.e., all classes should have .cpp and .h files).
3. One abstract class with an abstract method that is implemented in a child class. This should be integrated into your code in Point 1.
4. Correct and appropriate use of the access specifiers public, private, and protected with your classes.
5. Passing an object to a function by value and by reference. Demonstrate the impact of the change on the states of your object.
6. Calling a method on an object that is const qualified and passing the same object to a function by constant reference.
7. Correct use of new and delete for the allocation of an object/objects, with operations on the object using pointers.
8. Create an array of pointers to objects (minimum 3 elements) of one of your classes and pass this array to a function that displays all elements.
9. A simple destructor with some basic functionality in one of your classes. Demonstrate two examples of how it can be called.
10. Use of dynamic binding with virtual & non-virtual methods. Demonstrate the impact.
11. Correct use of three overloaded operators (e.g., +, = and ==) for one of your classes. 
12. Implement a non-member operator in one of your classes.
13. Write code to demonstrate an object passing itself to a function (that is not part of a class), which modifies the state of that object.
14. A class with a modified copy constructor and demonstrate the effect of this on pass-by-value and pass-by-reference calls.
15. Use of two different C++ explicit style casts. 
16. Implement static states and methods in one of your classes and show example usage and impact.
17. Demonstrates the difference between a C++ class and a C++ struct.
18. Write a straightforward example class template using the examples in the notes.
19. Use of the vector container to contain a number of objects of one of your classes using the examples in the notes.
20.Use of an algorithm on your container using the examples in the notes.
